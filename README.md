Dos attack using ns2

DoS Attack Simulation

This project simulates a denial-of-service (DoS) attack using ns-2. The attack is simulated by sending a large number of packets to a target node. The target node will be unable to respond to legitimate traffic, resulting in a denial of service.

Installation
To install the project, you will need to have ns-2 installed. 

Usage
To run the project, you will need to modify the dos.tcl file to specify the target node and the number of packets to send. Once you have modified the dos.tcl file, you can run the project by typing the following command in the ns-2 directory:
ns dos.tcl

Output
The output of the project will be a log file that shows the number of packets sent and the number of packets received by the target node. The log file will also show the time it took for the target node to become unavailable.
